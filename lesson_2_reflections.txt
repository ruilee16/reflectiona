What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository by using git init command, a .git file would be created and I think this file help to keep records of every commit author enters.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Well, I guess staging area just store file or files that author wants to commit, and it could be commited to a git repository while working directory is a phycal stack at my computer which contains all files.
